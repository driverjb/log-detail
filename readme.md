# Log Detail

There are many great logging solutions available, but many of them are either a headache to configure or contain a mountain of documentation to wade through before you can effectively use. I wanted _my_ preferred output with a simple setup. I ingest logs with Splunk and these are parsed right out of the box.

# Example

```javascript
const { setConfiguration, Writer } = require('./build');

setConfiguration({
  appName: 'MyApp',
  enabled: true,
  level: 'info'
  color: 'none' //options are 'none', 'basic', 'full'
});

let userLog = new Writer('api:user');
let groupLog = new Writer('api:group');
let specificGroup = groupLog.spawnSubWriter('MyGroup');

userLog.info('New user created', { username: 'Joel' });
groupLog.info('New group created', { groupname: 'MyGroup' });
specificGroup.info('User added to group', { username: 'Joel' });
```

# Output

```text
2020-03-15 23:53:57 myHost MyApp[21956]: info api:user [username='Joel'] New user created
2020-03-15 23:53:57 myHost MyApp[21956]: info api:group [groupname='MyGroup'] New group created
2020-03-15 23:53:57 myHost MyApp[21956]: info api:group:MyGroup [username='Joel'] User added to group
```

# UUID

When creating applications I have found it useful to add a unique identifier to each inbound request and then carry that through every log event generated by the request. This allows me to search my log file for a given unique identifier and discover every related event from the request that created it. Very helpful when troubleshooting a problem with the system. If you provide the `uuid` string parameter it will be added to the data output block in the log entry.
